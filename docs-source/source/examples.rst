2D Fragmentation Example
------------------------

This example demonstrates how to use **Crispy** to load a set of files obtained from a `GranOO <https://www.granoo.org/>`__ simulation of 2D disc impact and visualize fragmentation over time.

Code Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   # load files
   files = cp.load_files("files/", extension="agdd")

   # detect fragments from stacked files
   fragments_history = cp.detect_fragment(files)

   # stackplot
   cp.stackplot(fragments_history)

   # plot fragments at iteration 10
   cp.plot(fragments_history[9])

After loading files and detect fragments, this will generate a stack plot of the area repartition of each fragment of iteration nÂ°10, 
as well as one plot of the fragments, colored and labelled.

.. note::

   Make sure the work directory contains valid input files, the iteration sorting process is based on filename.

Run the Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full 2D fragmentation example is available in the project repository, inside the ``examples/2D_impact`` folder.

To run it locally, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples/2D_impact
   python 2D_impact.py

This script will execute the 2D fragmentation detection.

.. note::
   Make sure you have installed all required dependencies listed in the :ref:`installation` section before running the example.

You can inspect or modify the source code here:

- :file:`examples/2D_impact/2D_impact.py`
- input files are stored in :file:`examples/2D_impact/files/`

For more details on input file format, see the :ref:`usage` section.
